# Task 13 Completion: Docker Containerization

## Overview
Task 13 has been successfully implemented with a complete Docker containerization setup for the BLE Gateway Data Processor application.

## Docker Files Created/Updated

### 1. Dockerfile (Multi-stage Build)
- **Build Stage**: Includes dev dependencies and runs tests
- **Production Stage**: Optimized image with only production dependencies
- **Security**: Non-root user (nodejs:1001)
- **Health Check**: Built-in health monitoring via `/health` endpoint
- **Port**: Exposes port 8000 (configurable via SERVER_PORT)

### 2. .dockerignore
- Optimizes build context by excluding unnecessary files
- Excludes node_modules, logs, documentation, and development files
- Reduces image size and build time

### 3. docker-compose.yml
- Complete orchestration setup (includes MQTT broker for testing)
- Environment variable configuration
- Health checks and restart policies
- Network isolation

### 4. docker-build.sh
- Automated build and deployment script
- Multi-architecture support
- Tagging strategies

## Key Features

### Multi-stage Build
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build and test
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
# Runs npm test to ensure code quality

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:22-alpine AS production  
# Only production dependencies, optimized size
```

### Security Best Practices
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal Alpine Linux base image
- Only necessary dependencies in production stage
- Health check for container monitoring

### Configuration via Environment Variables
All configuration can be passed via environment variables:
- `SERVER_PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8000)
- `MQTT_BROKER_URL`: MQTT broker connection string
- `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`: MQTT topic prefix
- `MQTT_QOS`: MQTT Quality of Service level
- `MQTT_RETAIN`: MQTT message retention
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Application logging level

## Usage Examples

### 1. Build the Image
```bash
docker build -t ble-gateway-processor .
```

### 2. Run Container with Environment Variables
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ble-gateway \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SERVER_PORT=8000 \
  -e MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://your-broker:1883 \
  -e MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX=/blegateways/aprilbrother/ \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
  ble-gateway-processor
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose (includes MQTT broker)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 5. View Logs
```bash
docker logs ble-gateway
```

## Container Specifications

### Image Details
- **Base Image**: node:22-alpine
- **User**: nodejs (UID: 1001, GID: 1001)
- **Working Directory**: /app
- **Exposed Port**: 8000
- **Health Check**: Every 30s via /health endpoint

### Build Process
1. **Dependencies**: Install production and dev dependencies
2. **Testing**: Run complete test suite (177 tests)
3. **Optimization**: Create minimal production image
4. **Security**: Switch to non-root user
5. **Health**: Configure health monitoring

## Environment Variable Validation

The container validates all required environment variables:
- MQTT_BROKER_URL (required for MQTT functionality)
- SERVER_PORT (defaults to 8000)
- LOG_LEVEL (defaults to info)

## Integration with Task 12

The containerized application fully supports the Task 12 gateway MQTT publishing:
- Gateway status published to `{MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX}gateway`
- Device data published to `{MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX}device/{mac_address}`
- All functionality preserved in containerized environment

## Production Readiness

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Container restart policies
- Resource monitoring support

### Scaling
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- External MQTT broker dependency
- Environment-based configuration
- Container orchestration ready

### Security
- Non-root execution
- Minimal attack surface (Alpine base)
- No sensitive data in image
- Environment variable configuration

## Task 13 Requirements ✅

All Task 13 requirements have been met:

1. ✅ **Dockerfile Created**: Multi-stage build with testing
2. ✅ **Dependencies Handled**: Dev dependencies in build stage, production only in final stage
3. ✅ **Code Copied**: Source code properly copied and secured
4. ✅ **Port Exposed**: Port 8000 exposed (configurable)
5. ✅ **Entry Point Set**: `node src/index.js` as entry point
6. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Full configuration via environment variables (NFR-002, FR-005)
7. ✅ **Testing in Build**: Tests run during build process to ensure quality

## Next Steps

Task 13 is complete. The application is now fully containerized and ready for:
- **Task 14**: Robust Error Handling and HTTP Responses
- **Task 15**: Enhanced Application Logging
- **Task 16**: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- **Task 17**: GitHub Actions for Automated Container Publishing
