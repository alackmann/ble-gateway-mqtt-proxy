# Task 6 Completion Summary

## ✅ Task 6: Setup Basic Logging Framework

### Completed Components

1. **Basic Logging Module (`src/logger.js`)**
   - ✅ Implemented configurable log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
   - ✅ Created structured logging functions with timestamp formatting
   - ✅ Added support for logging objects and primitive data
   - ✅ Implemented log level filtering based on configuration

2. **Log Level Support**
   - ✅ ERROR (priority 0) - Highest priority
   - ✅ WARN (priority 1) 
   - ✅ INFO (priority 2) - Default level
   - ✅ DEBUG (priority 3) - Lowest priority
   - ✅ Configurable via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable

3. **Core Logging Functions**
   - ✅ `error(message, data)` - Error-level logging
   - ✅ `warn(message, data)` - Warning-level logging  
   - ✅ `info(message, data)` - Info-level logging
   - ✅ `debug(message, data)` - Debug-level logging

4. **Specialized Logging Functions**
   - ✅ `logStartup(port)` - Application startup information
   - ✅ `logRequest(method, path, contentType, sourceIP, bodySize)` - HTTP request details
   - ✅ `logProcessingSuccess(deviceCount, gatewayInfo)` - Successful data processing
   - ✅ `logProcessingError(operation, error, context)` - Processing errors with context
   - ✅ `logMqttConnection(event, details)` - MQTT connection events
   - ✅ `logMqttPublish(topic, success, error, messageId)` - MQTT publishing events

5. **Message Formatting**
   - ✅ ISO 8601 timestamp format: `[2025-06-03T10:30:00.123Z]`
   - ✅ Level prefix: `ERROR:`, `WARN:`, `INFO:`, `DEBUG:`
   - ✅ JSON serialization for object data
   - ✅ String conversion for primitive data

6. **Integration with Main Application**
   - ✅ Updated `src/index.js` to use new logging framework
   - ✅ Replaced all `console.log/warn/error` calls with structured logging
   - ✅ Added detailed logging for HTTP requests, decoding operations, and errors
   - ✅ Enhanced error context with source IP, content types, and operation details

7. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - ✅ **24 logging-specific tests** covering all functionality
   - ✅ Log level configuration and environment variable handling
   - ✅ Basic logging function behavior and output verification
   - ✅ Message formatting (timestamps, JSON objects, primitive data)
   - ✅ Specialized logging functions with realistic data
   - ✅ Log level filtering (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG precedence)
   - ✅ Console output capture and validation

### Key Features Implemented

**Log Level Filtering:**
- Only logs at or above the configured level are output
- Default INFO level shows ERROR, WARN, and INFO messages
- DEBUG level shows all messages including detailed debugging information

**Structured Logging:**
- Consistent timestamp formatting across all log messages
- JSON serialization for complex data objects
- Contextual information for troubleshooting (source IPs, operation details)

**Application-Specific Logging:**
- HTTP request tracking with method, path, content-type, source IP, and body size
- Gateway data processing success/failure with device counts and gateway information
- Future MQTT connection and publishing event logging (ready for Tasks 10-11)

### Test Results

### Log Output Examples

**Startup:**
```
[2025-06-03T10:30:00.123Z] INFO: BLE Gateway Data Processor starting on port 8000
[2025-06-03T10:30:00.124Z] INFO: Log level set to: info
[2025-06-03T10:30:00.125Z] INFO: MQTT broker: mqtt://localhost:1883
```

**HTTP Request:**
```
[2025-06-03T10:30:15.456Z] INFO: Request: POST /tokendata {"contentType":"application/msgpack","sourceIP":"192.168.1.100","bodySize":"1024 bytes"}
```

**Processing Success:**
```
[2025-06-03T10:30:15.467Z] INFO: Successfully processed 5 devices {"gateway":{"version":"1.5.0","messageId":12345,"ip":"192.168.1.100","mac":"12:34:56:78:9A:BC"}}
```

**Error Handling:**
```
[2025-06-03T10:30:15.478Z] ERROR: Error during request body decoding: Unexpected token {"operation":"request body decoding","context":{"contentType":"application/json","sourceIP":"192.168.1.100","bodyLength":256}}
```

### Next Steps (Future Tasks)
The logging framework is now ready for:
- Gateway data parsing logging (Task 7)
- BLE device parsing operation logging (Task 8) 
- JSON transformation logging (Task 9)
- MQTT client connection and publishing logging (Tasks 10-11)
- Comprehensive error tracking and debugging (Tasks 13-15)

### Technical Notes
- All console.log statements replaced with structured logging calls
- Log level configuration through environment variables
- Object and primitive data properly formatted in log messages
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures logging reliability
- Ready for integration with upcoming MQTT and data processing components
