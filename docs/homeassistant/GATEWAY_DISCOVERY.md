# Gateway Discovery Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of automatic gateway discovery for Home Assistant in the BLE Gateway Data Processor. This feature enables the gateway's status information to be automatically discovered and represented as sensors within Home Assistant, following the MQTT Auto Discovery protocol.

## Implementation Details

### Gateway Device in Home Assistant

The BLE Gateway itself is now represented as a device in Home Assistant with multiple sensors:

- **Version**: The firmware version of the gateway
- **IP Address**: The current IP address of the gateway
- **MAC Address**: The hardware MAC address of the gateway
- **Message ID**: The message ID from the gateway
- **Gateway Time**: The internal time of the gateway
- **Last Ping**: The timestamp when the gateway last sent data

### MQTT Topic Structure

The gateway status data is now published to a dedicated state topic:

- **Old Topic**: `blegateway/gateway`
- **New Topic**: `blegateway/gateway/state`

This aligns with the structure used for BLE devices and follows the Home Assistant best practices.

### Configuration

The gateway discovery is automatically included when Home Assistant integration is enabled (`HA_ENABLED=true`). A new environment variable has been added to customize the gateway's display name in Home Assistant:

- **`HA_GATEWAY_NAME`**: (String, default `April Brother BLE Gateway`) The friendly name for the gateway device in Home Assistant

### Publishing Behavior

1. **Discovery Messages**: When the application starts and Home Assistant integration is enabled, discovery messages are published for both the BLE devices and the gateway.

2. **State Updates**: The gateway status data is published to the state topic whenever the gateway sends an update.

3. **Retention**: Gateway state messages are never retained (always `retain: false`), while discovery messages are always retained.

## Code Changes

The following changes were made to implement gateway discovery:

1. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Added `gatewayName` to the Home Assistant configuration section
   - Removed the separate toggle for gateway discovery since it's now always included when HA is enabled

2. **MQTT Topic Structure**:
   - Updated `constructGatewayTopic()` to use `gateway/state` instead of just `gateway`
   - Ensured gateway state messages are never retained

3. **Discovery Publishing**:
   - Updated the Home Assistant discovery publisher to always include gateway discovery messages
   - Updated sensor configurations to use the new state topic

4. **Documentation and Tests**:
   - Updated tests to cover the gateway discovery functionality
   - Updated documentation and example configuration

## Testing

Unit tests have been added to verify:

1. The gateway device object creation
2. The gateway sensor configurations
3. The discovery message publishing process
4. The new topic structure

## Benefits

1. **Unified Dashboard**: All gateway and BLE device information can be viewed in a single Home Assistant dashboard
2. **Automatic Updates**: Sensor values update automatically as new data is received
3. **Centralized Monitoring**: Gateway health and status can be monitored alongside BLE device data
4. **Consistent Structure**: Uses the same MQTT topic structure pattern as BLE devices

## Next Steps

For end-to-end testing:

1. Run the application with `HA_ENABLED=true`
2. Verify the gateway device appears in Home Assistant
3. Check that all gateway sensors update correctly
4. Verify the topic structure using an MQTT client
