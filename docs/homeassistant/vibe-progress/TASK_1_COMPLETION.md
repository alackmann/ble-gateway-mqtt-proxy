# Task 1 Completion: Update Configuration Module for HA Specifics

## Description
Enhanced the configuration loading logic to read the new environment variables for Home Assistant integration.

## Implemented Changes
1. Added new configuration section `homeAssistant` to the `config` object with:
   - `enabled`: Boolean flag parsed from `HA_ENABLED` environment variable
   - `discoveryTopicPrefix`: String from `HA_DISCOVERY_TOPIC_PREFIX` environment variable, defaults to 'homeassistant'
   - `devices`: Map populated from parsed `HA_BLE_DEVICE_X` environment variables

2. Added the `parseHomeAssistantDevices()` function that:
   - Iterates through environment variables starting with `HA_BLE_DEVICE_1` and incrementing
   - Parses each variable's value in the format `MAC,Name`
   - Validates MAC format (12 hex characters without colons)
   - Populates a Map with MAC as the key and `{name: string}` as the value
   - Includes error handling for malformed inputs

3. Updated the validation logic to check:
   - If `HA_ENABLED` is true but no valid devices are configured

4. Enhanced logging to display Home Assistant configuration details:
   - Whether integration is enabled
   - Discovery topic prefix
   - Number of configured devices
   - List of configured devices with their names and MAC addresses

## Next Steps
- Implement MAC formatting and slugify helper functions
- Develop Home Assistant discovery publisher logic
- Test the configuration parsing with valid and invalid inputs

## Files Changed
- `/src/config.js`
