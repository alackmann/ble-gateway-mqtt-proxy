# Task 4 Completion: Integrate Discovery Publisher into Application Startup

## Description
Modified the main application entry point to call the Home Assistant discovery publisher after the MQTT client successfully connects.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Main Application Entry Point (`index.js`)
- Added import for the Home Assistant discovery module
- Updated the `initializeApplication` function to:
  - Check if Home Assistant integration is enabled
  - Call the `publishDiscoveryMessages` function after successful MQTT client connection
  - Log results of the discovery message publishing process
  - Handle and log any errors during discovery message publishing
  - Set up a periodic (once per minute) check to publish discovery messages for any newly configured devices

### 2. Integration with Existing Initialization Flow
- Maintained the existing error handling for MQTT connection failures
- Preserved the application startup sequence while adding the Home Assistant integration
- Added appropriate logging to indicate the status of Home Assistant integration

## Features
- Initial publishing of discovery messages upon application startup
- Periodic publishing (every 60 seconds) to ensure any new devices are discovered
- Robust error handling that allows the application to continue functioning even if discovery message publishing fails
- Clear logging of the Home Assistant integration status and actions

## Files Modified
- `/src/index.js` - Updated to integrate the Home Assistant discovery publisher

## Next Steps
- Implement breaking change for state topic publishing (Task 5)
- Write unit/integration tests for HA integration (Task 6)
- Update documentation for Docker environment variables (Task 7)

## Notes
- The periodic discovery message publishing aligns with the specification in TSD Section 5.3
- The implementation ensures discovery messages are only published after the MQTT client successfully connects
- Error handling allows the application to continue functioning even if Home Assistant integration fails
