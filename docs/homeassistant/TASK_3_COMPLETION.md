# Task 3 Completion: Develop Home Assistant Discovery Publisher Logic

## Description
Implemented the Home Assistant Discovery Publisher logic to construct and publish MQTT Auto Discovery messages for configured BLE devices. The implementation follows the specification in TSD Section 5.3.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Home Assistant Discovery Publisher Module (`ha-discovery.js`)
- Created a new module specifically for handling Home Assistant discovery message publishing
- Implemented the `publishDiscoveryMessages` function that:
  - Iterates through the `haDeviceMap` from the configuration
  - Constructs the Home Assistant config payloads for both RSSI and Last Seen sensors
  - Publishes these messages with `retain: true` on configured topics
  - Tracks which devices have already had discovery messages published
  - Only publishes discovery messages for new devices on subsequent calls
- Implemented robust error handling and logging throughout the process

### 2. Helper Functions
- `createDeviceObject`: Creates the common device object for Home Assistant discovery
- `createRssiSensorConfig`: Creates the RSSI sensor configuration payload
- `createLastSeenSensorConfig`: Creates the Last Seen sensor configuration payload
- `publishDeviceDiscovery`: Handles publishing for a single device with appropriate error handling

### 3. Integration with Existing Code
- Uses the MAC formatting and slugify utility functions created in Task 2
- Integrates with the MQTT client for message publishing
- Uses the configuration values from the config module
- Utilizes the logger for appropriate error reporting and status updates

### 4. Unit Tests
- Comprehensive test suite for the discovery publisher module
- Tests for all helper functions and main publishing logic
- Coverage for error conditions and edge cases
- Mock testing of MQTT client interactions

## Files Created
- `/src/ha-discovery.js` - Implementation of the Home Assistant Discovery Publisher
- `/test/ha-discovery.test.js` - Unit tests for the discovery publisher

## Next Steps
- Integrate the Discovery Publisher into the application startup flow
- Implement the state topic publishing changes
- Write integration tests for the complete flow

## Notes
- The discovery publisher keeps track of published devices to avoid duplicating messages
- Messages are only published when Home Assistant integration is enabled
- The implementation aligns with the Home Assistant MQTT Auto Discovery protocol requirements
